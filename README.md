## Development Progression Outline

#### Alpha Version

**Front-End:** The alpha version of Project SpendWise will include a minimally interactive skeleton of the web application. Users of the website will at this point be able to navigate from the homepage through to all the pages that will be available by the final version. The general layout and basic design elements of each page should be apparent by this point.

#### Beta Version

**Front-End:** The Beta version of Project SpendWise will seek intergrate server-side generated elements into the Frontend. By the Beta Version, users will be able to both view data originating from the backend (i.e., transaction data) as well as inputting user generated data from the front-end (i.e., profile data). Data visualization tools will also be implemented to some extent by the Beta version, allowing users to have their transaction data visualized in a limited manner.

#### Final Version

**Front-End:** The Final version of Project SpendWise will ensure that users can interact with all implemented features in a fast and intuitive manner. Design elements will be fully polished in the final version, giving SpendWise a clean and professional feel. Robust transaction visualization and the ability to display all transactions by a user's desired categories will also be available by this time.
